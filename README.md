# PhysicsEngine
I really need to stop making stuff in pygame

Kind of physics engine thing that I made in pygame.
It is really basic and not the best way to do it but I like it.

## How To Run
Theres two options, either you can run it locally (if you have python installed)
or you can find an online version of the project here: ~link when i get around to uploading it~

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository (or download the zip)
2. Open the terminal where the project is located and run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (this installs the requirements to run the project)
3. Run `python3 ./src/main.py` to start the project
